# react-cursor-position

A React component that decorates its children with mouse cursor coordinates plotted relative to itself.

Supports scroll position changes between and during active hover sessions.

Intended as a primitive for composing UI features that require notification of
mouse cursor position status.

Safe for server rendering and single page applications.

## Demo
The react-image-magnify project depends on this package for mouse coordinate observation.
Please have a look at the [react-image-magnify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-magnify)
demo to see this package in action.

Both projects have a similar interface.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-cursor-position
```

## Usage

```JSX
import ReactCursorPosition from 'react-cursor-position';
...

<ReactCursorPosition>
    <YourComponentOne/>
    <YourComponentTwo/>
</ReactCursorPosition>
```
ReactCursorPosition wraps its children in a div, which mouse cursor position
is plotted relative to.

Each child component will receive a prop named `cursorPosition`, which has the following structure.
This structure, and property name, may also be altered by implementing the optional `mapChildProps` feature.

```JavaScript
{
    x: Number,
    y: Number,
    isOutside: Boolean
}
```

## Props API

`className` : String - Optionally provide a CSS class to be applied to the div rendered by react-cursor-position.

`style` : Object - Optionally provide a style object to be applied to the div rendered by react-cursor-position.

`onCursorPositionChanged` : Function - Optionally provide a function that will be called when mouse cursor position changes.
Function will receive `cursorPosition` object as parameter.

`mapChildProps` : Function - Optionally model child component props. Function receives an object as input and returns
an object that will decorate child components.
See [example code](https://github.com/ethanselzer/react-cursor-position/blob/master/example/src/App.js#L33).
Defaults to `cursorPosition` structure outlined in [Usage](#usage) section.

`shouldDecorateChildren` : Boolean - Defaults to true. Optionally suppress `cursorPosition` decoration of child components by
setting this prop false.

## Example Project
```ssh
git clone https://github.com/ethanselzer/react-cursor-position.git
cd react-cursor-position/example
npm install
npm start
```

If your default browser does not start automatically, open a new browser window and go to localhost:3000

## Development

```ssh
git clone https://github.com/ethanselzer/react-cursor-position.git
cd react-cursor-position
npm install
npm run #print available commands
```
The Example Project may be used in development of react-cursor-position. To import ReactCursorPosition
from your local project change any import of ReactCursorPosition, on files in the components folder, to:

`import ReactCursorPosition from '../../../dist/ReactCursorPosition';`

At this time, the command `npm run prepublsih` must be run from the root of the project each time you want
your ReactCursorPosition changes to be reflected in the example.

If you experience ReferenceError: Unknown plugin "'transform-es2015-modules-umd'" when running
`prepublish` you may try running `npm run prepublish-cjs` instead.
